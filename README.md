# RubaXa:Sortable Meteor demo
This is a completely stripped down version of this demo :

  --  http://rubaxa-sortable.meteor.com

I got it all to work with a much simpler run command and no reference to external / parent directories.

I was able to remove autopublish, **but I was NOT able to remove insecure**.

Execution
--------------

Edit qrun.sh to either correct or comment out the MONGO_URL specification, then simpley do :

     bash qrun.sh
